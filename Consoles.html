<h1 align="center"> Why consoles? </h1>

   <p>	Consoles are probably more of what a person would associate gaming with because consoles involve controllers and that's probably what people attribute to it. Console gaming is also one of the biggest gaming platforms of them all because of the amount of playable games on it and for its price. There are different consoles such as Xbox, PS4 or Nintendo switch. Of course there are more but these are probably the most played and up to date consoles. Consoles cost around 300-350 dollars which is why there is a bigger audience with it. </p>

	<p>Additionally, there isnâ€™t a superior console and they each come with their own aspects such as video games that are exclusive to them like xbox having Halo, PS4 having god of war, and Nintendo having Super Smash Bros or Mario. You might see jokes online about which one is better or why the other one is worse because of the huge player base that is divided amongst them. If you wanted to have a fun time with friends then consoles were a good place to enjoy that. Consoles have a competitive community that comes with it if you want to play a game professionally.</p>
