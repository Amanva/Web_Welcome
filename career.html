 <p>There are a lot of careers that are involved with games but why don't we look at the careers that are on the playing side of games instead of the creating side. If you looked at Esports then you know that being a pro player is a career that you can get out of it. If you are signed to a team, you would get paid just for playing the game or creating content about it which is something a lot of gamers who are able to play professionally do.

	<p>Another big career that you can make out of playing games is streaming which is more common than being a pro player. There are a lot of people that want to be professional streamers even though it's a lot harder than it seems. Streaming is a career that isnâ€™t only based off games but can be other genres too. However, Gaming is probably what streaming is more associated with which is why when you get on twitch a streaming app, it mostly asks what games do you like watching. One of the biggest streamers like Ninja or shroud used to have an average of 40-50k viewers when they were at their prime. Streaming is a career that can offer a lot of money if the streamer has a successful channel. Ninja was a streamer who streamed fortnite and managed to have a really big twitch channel where he would make 500k a month just from playing the game.
