<h1 align="center"> Why PC gaming? </h1>

   <p>	PC gaming is another form of gaming and this is where people buy PC’s if they want to take gaming to the next level either professionally or for a better experience. PC’s are the highest form of gaming at this time because of the huge gap between consoles and PC. PC’s cost a lot more than consoles and can range anywhere from 500-3000 dollars which makes it hard for a casual person to get one. The gap between PC and console is so huge because PC has phenomenal graphics, better connection, and stellar performance compared to consoles. Consoles cap at 60 FPS while PC’s can range from 30-240 FPS depending on the PC. Anybody who loves playing games wants to have a PC because of how good it is. Most of the competitive gaming community plays on a PC because of the features it has and its performance. They usually make the switch to PC from console if they are a pro in a multi-platform game.

	<p>PC’s are expensive which makes it hard for people to obtain one but PC gaming is becoming more and more prevalent as time goes on. PC also has an option to upgrade if you don't want to spend too much money on your PC. You can buy parts to upgrade it to make it better which is something you don't have compared to console or mobile. PC also has games that are only exclusive on that platform because it would be hard to implement some games in console because of the controller format. But with PC you have a mouse and keyboard which allows for more precision in games like CSGO or Escape From Tarkov. </p>
